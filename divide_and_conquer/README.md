# Divide and Conquer Algorithms
This directory contains implementations of algorithms that use the **divide-and-conquer** paradigm.  
Divide-and-conquer works by recursively breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each independently, and combining the results.

## Implemented Algorithms

- **[Karatsuba Multiplication](karatsuba/)** â€“ Fast multiplication for large integers in `O(n^1.585)` time.
- **[Merge Sort](mergesort/)** - Canonical divide and conquer sorting algorithm in `O(n*log(n))` time.
