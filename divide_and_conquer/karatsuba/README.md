# âš¡ Karatsuba Multiplication Algorithm (C Implementation)

Karatsuba's algorithm is a **divide-and-conquer** method for multiplying two large integers faster than the standard `O(nÂ²)` gradeschool algorithm.  
It achieves a time complexity of approximately **O(n^1.585)**, making it significantly faster for large inputs.


## ðŸ§  Algorithm Overview

Given two `n`-digit numbers `x` and `y`, Karatsuba works as follows:

1. **Split** each number into two halves:
    - `x = a*10^n + b`
    - `y = c*10^n + d`
2. **Compute:**
- `ac` â€“ product of the high parts
- `bd` â€“ product of the low parts
- `(a + b)(c + d) - ac - bd` â€“ the "cross term"
3. Combine results to get the final product.

This reduces the number of multiplications from **4** to **3**, giving a faster runtime.
