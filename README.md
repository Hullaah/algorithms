# ðŸ“š Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of classic algorithms and data structures in pure C, organized by category.

The aim is to deeply understand algorithmic priciples by implementing everything from scratch without relying on language-specific shortcuts

Currently, the repository is following along with [Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) and will later expand to include content from other well-known courses and books.

## ðŸ§  Why C?

C gives a deeper understanding of how algorithms behave at the memory and performance level.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- `divide_and_conquer` - Divide and Conquer algorithms
- `include` - Reusable headers
